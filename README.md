# Extracting Titles from Search Results using Console of Chrome DevTools

Chrome DevTools is a powerful tool that allows developers to debug, inspect, and understand how their web applications are functioning. One useful feature of DevTools is the ability to extract titles from search results using the console. Here's how to do it:

1.  Open Chrome DevTools by right-clicking on a webpage and selecting "Inspect" or by using the shortcut `F12`.
2.  In the DevTools window, click the `Sources` tab.
3.  In the `Sources` tab, click the `Snippets` tab. This will open the Snippets editor.
4.  In the Snippets editor, click `New snippet`. This will create a new snippet and open an editor window.
5.  Paste the code written in `extract.js` into the editor window. This code will extract the titles of search results from a webpage.
6.  To run the snippet, press `cmd + enter` if you are using macOS. On Windows, use `ctrl + enter`.
7.  When the snippet is run, a `console.json` file will download. This file will contain the extracted titles from the search results.

Using this method, you can easily extract titles from search results and use the data for various purposes. Whether you are a developer or just interested in collecting data from search results, the Chrome DevTools console is a useful tool to have in your toolkit.
